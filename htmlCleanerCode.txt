use the following code in case the full College List gets messed up. This turns html into a coherent list of colleges:


''' This was used to change messy html into a coherent list of all colleges
def clean_html(s):
    cleanText = re.sub('<.*?>', '', s)
    cleanText = re.sub('[0-9]', '', cleanText)
    cleanText = re.sub('\#', '', cleanText)
    cleanText = re.sub('\([^)]*\)', '', cleanText)
    cleanText = cleanText.replace('&', '')
    cleanText = cleanText.replace(';', '').strip()
    return cleanText

cleanArray = [clean_html(s) for s in htmlArray]
cleanArray = [s for s in cleanArray if len(s) > 1]
