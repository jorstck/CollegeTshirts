I just wanted to write to you personally because I've heard good things about your campus and school and am interested. I'm a junior student from Spotsylvania, Virginia, and I wanted to see if you had any t-shirts, sweatshirts, or any other paraphernalia available so I could represent your school!

I'm very interested computer science, math, physics, and psychology. I'm actually the president of my school's math honor society, Mu Theta Pi! My GPA is a solid 3.6 (on a 4 point scale), and I scored a 1510 on my most recent SAT (730 reading, 780 math). 

I'm very interested in your school; I feel like I would definitely shine there. If you have any t-shirts, sweatshirts, or such I'd appreciate it greatly!
My address is: 12703 Lake Wilderness Lane, Spotsylvania, Virginia 22551
Thank you so much!

Sincerely,
Jordan Stack
